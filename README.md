# Notes from an F# lecture given by Jon Harrop [@jdh30](https://github.com/jdh30)

Notes from an F# lecture delivered by Jon Harrop on May 12th and 13th 2014. 

## Synopsis: 

These are notes from a two day lecture on F#. My notes are in the "Notes"
files while what Jon typed out for us in the F# Interactive window are
included as "LectureCode" files. 

## How to read: 

* Code is in a solution but solution isn't meant to build 
* The complexity of the code is top down, left to right
* So the top of Day 1 is simplest and bottom of Day 2 is most complex
* Everything is designed to be executed in the F# Interactive window

## Extras: 

Beyond code the notes also include excerpts from comments from Jon in 
class and questions from the audience + my verbose reactions to various
pieces of code.
